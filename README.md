# EDA--Terrorism_Coderscave
The goal of this project is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the terrorism dataset to extract meaningful insights and patterns. By analyzing the dataset, we aim to uncover trends, identify high-risk regions, understand attack characteristics, and potentially reveal factors that contributes to terrorist activities.
